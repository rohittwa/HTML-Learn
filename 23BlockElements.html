        Every HTML element has a default display value, depending on what type of element it is.

        There are two display values: block and inline.
    -->

    <!--
        A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.

        A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

        Here are the block-level elements in HTML:

        <address><article><aside><blockquote><canvas><dd><div><dl><dt><fieldset><figcaption><figure><footer><form><h1>-<h6><header><hr><li><main><nav><noscript><ol><p><pre><section><table><tfoot><ul><video>

    <div style="background-color:black;color:white;padding:20px;">
        <h2>London</h2>

        <p>Standing on the River Thames, London has been a major settlement for two millennia, its history going back to its founding by the Romans, who named it Londinium.</p>
