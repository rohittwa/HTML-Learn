    Here is a quote from WWF's website:
    <blockquote>
        For 60 years, WWF has worked to help people and nature thrive. As the world's 
        <br>leading conservation organization, WWF works in nearly 100 countries. <br>
        At every level, we collaborate with people around the world to develop and <br>
        deliver innovative solutions that protect communities, wildlife, and the <br>
        places in which they live.
